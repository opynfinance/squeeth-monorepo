### Terms of Service FAQ

#### Frequently Asked Questions about the Squeeth Terms of Service

&nbsp;

##### Periodically, we update our [Terms of Service](https://opyn.co/terms-of-service) as we work to improve the Squeeth App user experience. We want our users to understand exactly what’s contained in updates and why we’ve made those updates.

&nbsp;


#### Q. What are the major changes in the August 25, 2022 Updated Terms of Service?

#### A. Opyn is implementing a new risk-management system that assesses and blocks Ethereum addresses associated with certain legally prohibited conduct  that attempt to interact with [opyn.co](https://opyn.co/).

&nbsp;

#### Q. What kind of risk are you hoping to assess and how?

#### A. We use [Chainalysis](https://demo.chainalysis.com/request-a-demo/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign={campaign}&utm_term=chainalysis&utm_content=558401973804&gclid=CjwKCAjwrNmWBhA4EiwAHbjEQCpNwFS8fzEmA-hBxxpdLQaX1jgTU4ZsiPPLZ8MZSeTWA_wLHg_LthoCLIgQAvD_BwE), a blockchain intelligence service provider. Chainalysis combines on-chain data and real-world investigations to identify financial crime and other high-risk activities. Opyn applies an industry-wide standard of risk categories (e.g., sanctions, ransomware, child exploitation, stolen funds). Addresses that fall into a risk category are blocked from accessing the Squeeth App. 

&nbsp;

#### Q. What data is collected in this process?

#### A. User wallet addresses connecting to the Squeeth app will be cross-checked using a Chainalysis API with designated risk categories. Your address is shared with Chainalysis, but no metadata or IP addresses are shared. Users will not be identified in this risk-assessment process.

&nbsp;

#### Q. Will this risk-assessment impact access to the Squeeth Protocol through other interfaces?

#### A. No. Only the Ethereum addresses interacting with the Squeeth app interface will be cross-checked against standards for risk assessment. This includes [opyn.co](https://opyn.co/). We will not be cross-checking the addresses of those interacting with the underlying Uniswap Protocol or other protocols via other interfaces. Given the Protocol’s decentralized and open-source nature, we do not control users’ access to it via any portal other than our own app.

&nbsp;

#### Q. What other APIs/data services does the Squeeth Interface use?

#### A. The Squeeth app also uses the Alchemy API, The Graph API, Fathom Analytics, and Sentry. Alchemy fetches on-chain data and constructs contract calls with the Alchemy API. The Graph API is used to obtain market data such as liquidity distribution of a pool. Fathom Analytics is used to learn more about user behavior and improve the user experience through anonymized data. We do not use cookies for Fathom Analytics. Sentry is used to record blocked address events that occur through the Chainalysis API. 

#### For more information on our API and data collection policies see Opyn’s Privacy Policy. 

&nbsp;

#### Q. My address was incorrectly blocked. How can I remedy this? 

#### A. If you believe your address has been incorrectly flagged, please contact legal@opyn.co.
