#### 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Opyn, Inc. (“Opyn”) Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use any information you submit when using the Interface, as defined within the Opyn User Terms of Service (“User Terms”). This Privacy Policy should be read in conjunction with the User Terms and is integrated into the User Terms. All capitalized proper nouns not defined in this Privacy Policy will have the same definitions and meanings as defined by the User Terms. Please review the Privacy Policy periodically as we may revise it from time to time. If you do not agree with or accept our Privacy Policy in its entirety, you must not access or use the Interface. If you use the Interface following a change to the terms of this Privacy Policy you agree to accept the revised policies. Please do not submit any information to us if you reside in a Restricted Territory or if you or your organization is a Restricted Person or US Person.

#### 2. Information Collected

At Opyn, we may collect the following information from you when you access or use the Interface:

- Digital Wallet address, transaction history, and other associated information.
- Interactions with the Interface including but not limited to usage data and preferences.
- Online identifiers like computer and browser information, operating system, data usage, data transferred, geo location, and IP address.
- Information provided by third parties or publicly accessible databases which we may combine with other information collected.

#### 3. Use of Your Information

Where applicable, we will use any information collected as directed by you and in accordance with the User Terms. Further, we may use your information in the following ways:

- To provide any services offered by the Interface, to process transactions, and to maintain, develop, and operate the Interface.
- To enforce the Privacy Policy or User Terms; to comply with applicable laws; to respond to third party, legal, and governmental inquiries; and to investigate any illegal or fraudulent activity.
- To enhance or improve our users’ experiences.
- To send and receive information to you via selected communication methods as set forth within the User Terms or where requested by you.
- To notify you of additional Opyn services and updates.
- To assist in maintaining the functionality, safety, and security of the Interface.
- To share your information with third party contractors hired by us to perform functions and provide services to us such as infrastructure providers, Blockchain Technology providers, marketing providers, and other vendors we use to make available the Interface.
- To release to governmental entities, authorities, or legal claimants as required.

#### 4. Analytics

Third party analytics tools collect or use information about your use of the Interface, which helps us improve the user experience. We want to process as little personal information as possible when you use the Interface. We use [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/amplitude-security-and-privacy), a user analytics platform, in order to track how users interact with the interface in order to establish, implement, and evaluate how to improve the user experience. Amplitude uses cookies to help analyze how users use the site. For more information on the Amplitude cookie and how to disable it, go to section [6.2 “Cookies the Interface Uses.”](#6-cookies)

#### 5. Sanctions and Risk Management

We use Chainalysis, a third party blockchain intelligence service provider to detect, prevent, and mitigate financial crime and other illicit or harmful activities on the Interface. Chainalysis combines on-chain data and real-world investigations to identify financial crime and other high-risk activities. Opyn applies an industry-wide standard of risk categories (e.g., sanctions, ransomware, child exploitation, stolen funds). Addresses that fall into a risk category are blocked from accessing the Squeeth App. User wallet addresses connecting to the Squeeth app will be cross-checked using a Chainalysis API with designated risk categories. Your address is shared with Chainalysis, but no metadata or IP addresses are shared. Users are not identified in this risk-assessment process.  We do not retain the information we collect any longer than necessary for these purposes.

[Sentry](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/enriching-events/context/) is used to record blocked address events that occur through the Chainalysis API.

#### 6. Cookies

When you first come to the Interface, you may receive a notification that cookies are present. By clicking or tapping “Accept,” you agree to the use of these cookies as described here. By tapping “Decline,” you refuse to accept cookies from the Interface. If you refuse cookies, you might not be able to use other cookie-dependent features of the Interface.
